Title: Waste Image Classification Using Deep Learning for Sustainable Recycling

Project Overview

This project tackles the problem of waste segregation by leveraging deep learning techniques to classify waste materials from images. Automated waste sorting is a key enabler for smart recycling systems, reducing landfill contamination and supporting environmental sustainability.

Problem Statement

Manual sorting of waste is inefficient, prone to errors, and exposes workers to hazardous materials. An image-based classification system can:

Rapidly identify and sort waste into appropriate categories (e.g., organic, recyclable)

Increase recycling rates and resource recovery

Reduce environmental pollution and landfill waste
